Used machine learning with PySpark on the "AI Impact on Jobs" dataset to predict job risk levels (low, medium, high) due to AI. Trained models like Decision Tree to classify jobs. Found repetitive roles at higher risk, while creative and human-focused jobs are safer. Helps guide upskilling decisions.
